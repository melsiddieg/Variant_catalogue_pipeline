Variant filtering

Filer 2 : Length
     Number of SV removed because of length (-50bp < length < 50bp) : 15624
     Percentage of SV removed because of length (-50bp < length < 50bp) : 9.052196130916169 %
Filer 3 : Filters
     Number of SV removed because of filters (non PASS) : 9701
     Percentage of SV removed because of filters (non PASS) : 6.179964962573658 %
Filer 4 : Hail QC, AN (Allele number)
     AN threshold for filtering : 136.5
